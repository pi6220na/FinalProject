MCTC Web Client Server Web Dev FINAL PROJECT

This is a simple "snake" game implemented in HTML/CSS/Javascript running on Node Express with MONGO Database. 

It does a simple sign-on validation, user information is saved in the database. 

The game is played by pressing the space bar (or g key at the end of a game) to start the snake moving. Use the keyboad arrow keys to 
change the direction the snake is moving. Try to eat apples to gain a point. Get 10 or more points and move to the next level (2). Hitting
walls or the snake's own body ends the round. Five lives per round. 

Work-in-progress but far from complete, adding in multi-player capability over the Internet using Sockets.IO to implement.
